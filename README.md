# meetup_calendar
aggregate meetup events into a single calendar



# Setup

Requirements:
   * Python 3


## Virtual Environment
TODO: make virtualenv

## Settings
Create a file `local.py` within the `settings` folder.
That will put your `local.py` next to `default.py`.
Any variables put in `local.py` will override the settings in `default.py`.
You'll want to at least override `meetup_api_key`.
See the block comment at the top of `default.py` for an example and brief instructions on how to do that.
